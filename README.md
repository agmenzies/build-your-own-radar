## How To Use

The easiest way to use the app out of the box is to provide a *public* Google Sheet ID from which all the data will be fetched. You can enter that ID into the input field on the first page of the application, and your radar will be generated. The data must conform to the format below for the radar to be generated correctly.

### Setting up your data

You need to make your data public in a form we can digest.

Create a Google Sheet. Give it at least the below column headers, and put in the content that you want:

| name          | ring   | quadrant               | isNew | description                                             |
|---------------|--------|------------------------|-------|---------------------------------------------------------|
| Composer      | adopt  | tools                  | TRUE  | Although the idea of dependency management ...          |
| Canary builds | trial  | techniques             | FALSE | Many projects have external code dependencies ...       |
| Apache Kylin  | assess | platforms              | TRUE  | Apache Kylin is an open source analytics solution ...   |
| JSF           | hold   | languages & frameworks | FALSE | We continue to see teams run into trouble using JSF ... |

### Sharing the sheet

* In Google sheets, go to 'File', choose 'Publish to the web...' and then click 'Publish'.
* Close the 'Publish to the web' dialog.
* Copy the URL of your editable sheet from the browser (Don't worry, this does not share the editable version). 

The URL will be similar to [https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1uu--borlaKFlfEe9pm-KhmCDOj9vIhTUXYNSoYoCNuk/edit?usp=sharing](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1uu--borlaKFlfEe9pm-KhmCDOj9vIhTUXYNSoYoCNuk/edit?usp=sharing). In theory we are only interested in the part between '/d/' and '/edit' but you can use the whole URL if you want.

### Using CSV data
The other way to provide your data is using CSV document format.
You can enter any URL that responds CSV data into the input field on the first page.
The format is just the same as that of the Google Sheet, the example is as follows:

```
name,ring,quadrant,isNew,description  
Composer,adopt,tools,TRUE,"Although the idea of dependency management ..."  
Canary builds,trial,techniques,FALSE,"Many projects have external code dependencies ..."  
Apache Kylin,assess,platforms,TRUE,"Apache Kylin is an open source analytics solution ..."  

JSF,hold,languages & frameworks,FALSE,"We continue to see teams run into trouble using JSF ..."  
```

Note: The CSV file parsing is using D3 library, so consult the D3 documentation for the data format details.

### Building the radar

Paste the URL in the input field on the home page.

That's it!

Note: the quadrants of the radar, and the order of the rings inside the radar will be drawn in the order they appear in your data.

### More complex usage

To create the data representation, you can use the Google Sheet [factory](/src/util/factory.js) or CSV, or you can also insert all your data straight into the code.

The app uses [Tabletop.js](https://github.com/jsoma/tabletop) to fetch the data from a Google Sheet or [D3.js](https://d3js.org/) if supplied as CSV, so refer to their documentation for more advanced interaction.  The input data is sanitized by whitelisting HTML tags with [sanitize-html](https://github.com/punkave/sanitize-html).

The application uses [webpack](https://webpack.github.io/) to package dependencies and minify all .js and .scss files.


## Docker Image - Custom for Coeus
There is a docker Repo for running the radar on your docker machine
(https://hub.docker.com/r/agmenzies/coeus-radar02). To pull and run the image, run the following commands.
```
$ docker pull agmenzies/coeus-radar02
$ docker run --rm -p 8080:80 -e SERVER_NAMES="localhost 127.0.0.1" agmenzies/coeus-radar02
$ open http://localhost:8080
```

## Configuring Ubuntu, run docker and launch Radar 
Use the commands once you have a running Ubuntu VM up and running
```
$ sudo apt-get remove docker docker-engine docker.io
$ sudo apt-get update
$ sudo apt-get install \
    apt-transport-https \
    ca-certificates \
    curl \
    software-properties-common
$ curl -fsSL https://download.docker.com/linux/ubuntu/gpg | sudo apt-key add -
$ sudo apt-key fingerprint 0EBFCD88

$ sudo apt-get update
$ sudo apt-get install docker-ce
$ sudo docker pull agmenzies/coeus-radar01
$ sudo docker run --rm -p 8080:80 -e SERVER_NAMES="localhost 127.0.0.1" agmenzies/coeus-radar02
```

## Docker Image - Thougtworks (Starting Point)
We have released BYOR as a docker image for our users. The image is available in our [DockerHub Repo](https://hub.docker.com/r/wwwthoughtworks/build-your-own-radar/). To pull and run the image, run the following commands.
```
$ docker pull wwwthoughtworks/build-your-own-radar
$ docker run --rm -p 8080:80 -e SERVER_NAMES="localhost 127.0.0.1" wwwthoughtworks/build-your-own-radar
$ open http://localhost:8080
```

## Contribute

    All tasks are defined in `package.json`.

Pull requests are welcome; please write tests whenever possible. 
Make sure you have nodejs installed.

- `git clone git@github.com:thoughtworks/build-your-own-radar.git`
- `npm install`
- `npm test` - to run your tests
- `npm run dev` - to run application in localhost:8080. This will watch the .js and .css files and rebuild on file changes

### Don't want to install node? Run with one line docker

     $ docker run -p 8080:8080 -v $PWD:/app -w /app -it node:7.3.0 /bin/sh -c 'npm install && npm run dev'

After building it will start on localhost:8080
